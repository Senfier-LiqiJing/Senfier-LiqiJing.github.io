## Overview

Generative AI models, particularly diffusion models, have demonstrated incredible capabilities in image synthesis. However, their practical deployment is often hindered by high latency and massive memory requirements.

This project focused on implementing and optimizing state-of-the-art generative models with conditional controls. By leveraging the **Diffusers** library and **ControlNet**, I aimed to significantly enhance inference speed and reduce resource consumption without compromising image quality.

## Performance Optimization

The core achievement of this project was optimizing the inference pipeline for resource-constrained environments.

### 1. High-Speed Inference
I implemented memory-efficient inference pipelines that drastically improved performance benchmarks. By optimizing the processing flow, the system achieved **3x faster inference speeds** compared to the standard baseline.

### 2. Memory Efficiency
To address the VRAM bottlenecks common in large diffusion models, I engineered optimizations that **reduced VRAM usage by 40%**. This included the implementation of grid visualization techniques, allowing for efficient batch processing and previewing.

## Advanced Training Strategies

Beyond inference optimization, I explored advanced methodologies to enhance model control and personalization:

* **Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning:** I developed an innovative training methodology for ControlNet by leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained diffusion models.
* **Personalization:** I applied cutting-edge fine-tuning strategies, including **DreamBooth** and **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, to create highly personalized generative models.

## Evaluation

To ensure the optimizations did not degrade output quality, I created a comprehensive evaluation framework. This allowed for the quantitative assessment of both image quality and control accuracy, ensuring that the speed gains were achieved while maintaining high-fidelity generation.
