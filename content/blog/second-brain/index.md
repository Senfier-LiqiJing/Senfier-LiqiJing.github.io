## Overview

Protein binder design is a challenging task that requires navigating a vast chemical space to find structures that bind specifically to a target. While diffusion models have shown promise, they often rely on denoising from Gaussian noise, which can be inefficient for modeling highly structured biological data.

**GenBinder** is a new project where I developed an end-to-end generative pipeline for T-cell receptor (TCR) binder design. The key innovation is formulating the generation process as an **Optimal Transport (OT)** problem between real biological distributions, rather than starting from random noise.

## Key Methodology

### 1. Flow Matching with Optimal Transport
Instead of standard diffusion, GenBinder uses **Flow Matching** to model binder generation. We define the generation as a structured transport process:
* **Source:** Distributions of existing TCRs and natural binders.
* **Target:** The specific binder distribution required for the antigen.

This "real-to-real" transport approach aims to be more biologically grounded than "noise-to-real" methods, potentially leading to higher quality candidates.

### 2. Sequence-Structure Coupled Training
A protein's function is inextricably partial to both its 3D geometry and its amino acid sequence. To address this, I implemented a **sequence-structure coupled training framework**. This ensures that the generated backbone geometries are compatible with their sequences, and the system features modular loss components to allow for flexible ablation studies and future extensions.

## Physically Motivated Constraints

To ensure the generated proteins are not just mathematically optimal but physically viable, I designed and integrated **physically motivated structural losses**.

These include specific **helicity-based geometric constraints** to encourage the formation of realistic secondary structures (like $\alpha$-helices) and avoid biologically implausible conformations.

## Project Status

The project currently has a **fully runnable training and evaluation pipeline**. I am currently working on integrating larger datasets and establishing comprehensive benchmarks to further validate the model's performance against state-of-the-art methods.
