## Overview

Recent advancements in neural rendering have revolutionized how we reconstruct and interact with 3D scenes. This independent research project at the University of Southern California focuses on investigating **Gaussian-based scene representations** that unify three critical components of computer vision: rendering, mapping, and geometry reasoning.

The core objective is to understand and extend frameworks that can perform real-time neural rendering while maintaining accurate geometric reconstruction, particularly suitable for robot perception.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Theoretical Foundations of 3DGS
I began by analyzing the theoretical underpinnings of **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)**. Unlike implicit representations (like NeRFs) which can be computationally expensive to query, 3DGS utilizes explicit 3D Gaussians for efficient radiance field modeling. This allows for high-fidelity real-time neural rendering, making it a promising candidate for interactive applications.

### 2. From Rendering to SLAM
A significant portion of this research examines the progression from static 3DGS to full **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** systems.

I specifically investigated systems like **Gaussian Splatting SLAM** and **HI-SLAM2**. The focus here is on **geometry-aware mapping**—ensuring that the system doesn't just produce pretty pictures, but also understands the underlying structure of the environment, even under challenging **monocular constraints**. This geometry awareness is crucial for robotics tasks where collision avoidance and path planning are necessary.

## Proposed Extensions

Building on existing literature, I proposed conceptual extensions to address current limitations in the field:

* **Dynamic Environments:** Adapting Gaussian-based SLAM to handle moving objects and changing scenes, rather than assuming a static world.
* **Large-Scale Mapping:** Bridging the gap between localized neural rendering and large-scale robot perception, enabling these systems to map extensive environments efficiently.

This exploration aims to bridge the gap between high-quality visual rendering and practical, geometry-aware robot perception.
